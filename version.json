  "description": "Frontend API Proxy Fixes & SQLAlchemy Log Suppression",
  "releaseDate": "2025-10-03",
  "releaseNotes": "Critical fixes for API proxy architecture and logging: (1) Fixed duplicate /api path bug in frontend - all API requests were generating /api/proxy/api/v1/... instead of /api/proxy/v1/...; (2) Updated 8 files (api.ts + 7 service/component files) to remove /api prefix from path constructions; (3) Added comprehensive regression tests (42 tests total) documenting 4 known bugs including service layer path errors; (4) Implemented SQLAlchemy log suppression using logging filter to eliminate query log pollution during database connectivity checks; (5) Added database startup validation in FastAPI lifespan to fail fast if PostgreSQL is not running; (6) All changes verified with passing test suite and clean startup logs showing only essential messages.",
