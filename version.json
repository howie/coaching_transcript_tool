  "releaseNotes": "Critical bug fixes for /api/plans/current endpoint that was causing 500 Internal Server Errors for authenticated users. Key fixes: (1) Resolved enum/string type inconsistency issues in SQLAlchemy model serialization by implementing defensive _get_plan_value() helper function; (2) Fixed AttributeError in subscription management where code was accessing non-existent 'next_billing_date' field instead of 'current_period_end'; (3) Applied fixes to both API layer (plans.py) and core business logic layer (plan_management_use_case.py) for complete resolution; (4) Enhanced error handling for enum value extraction across the plan management system. The Plans and Usage page now loads successfully for all authenticated users.",
