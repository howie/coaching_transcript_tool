  "description": "SQL Logging Control Enhancement",
  "releaseDate": "2025-09-22",
  "releaseNotes": "Enhanced SQL logging configuration with independent control: (1) Added SQL_ECHO environment variable for dedicated SQL query logging control; (2) Separated SQL logging from general DEBUG setting for fine-grained control; (3) Configured SQLAlchemy engine loggers to suppress verbose SQL queries by default; (4) SQL queries now hidden by default unless explicitly enabled with SQL_ECHO=true; (5) Maintains existing colorized logging for application events while cleaning up SQL noise; (6) Verified configuration works correctly with TEST_MODE server. Improved developer experience: cleaner logs for debugging while preserving ability to enable SQL debugging when needed.",
