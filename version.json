  "releaseDate": "2025-09-22",
  "releaseNotes": "Completed Clean Architecture migration for 14 API endpoints: (1) Migrated billing_analytics.py - 10 endpoints from direct DB access to dependency injection using use cases; (2) Migrated coaching_sessions.py - 4 endpoints enhanced with comprehensive data retrieval methods; (3) Created 10 new use case classes in core/services/billing_analytics_use_case.py; (4) Enhanced CoachingSessionRetrievalUseCase with session/client/transcription summary methods; (5) Added factory methods in infrastructure/factories.py for dependency injection; (6) Updated dependencies.py with proper use case dependency injection; (7) Fixed all linting errors - resolved undefined names and imports; (8) Verified smoke tests, unit tests, and server startup functionality. Architecture compliance: All migrated endpoints now follow Clean Architecture principles with proper separation of concerns between API layer, business logic (use cases), and data access (repositories). Remaining: 75 endpoints to migrate in subsequent phases.",
