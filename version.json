  "description": "WP3 - Subscriptions Vertical Slice Clean Architecture Refactor",
  "releaseDate": "2025-09-16",
  "releaseNotes": "Complete Clean Architecture refactor of subscription/payment system (WP3). Major improvements: (1) Refactored subscription API to remove direct SQLAlchemy dependencies - all business logic now handled through use cases following Clean Architecture principles; (2) Added comprehensive test coverage with unit tests (subscription use cases), integration tests (repository layer), and E2E tests (complete subscription workflows); (3) Enhanced transaction safety with explicit flush/rollback mechanisms; (4) Improved architecture compliance - API layer now handles only HTTP concerns while core business logic resides in use case layer; (5) Maintained full backward compatibility while significantly improving code maintainability and testability. Total: ~200 lines of business logic migrated from API to use case layer, ~600 lines of new test coverage added.",
