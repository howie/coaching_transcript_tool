  "description": "CI/CD Fix: Resolve GitHub Actions directory creation race condition",
  "releaseDate": "2025-10-04",
  "releaseNotes": "Fix GitHub Actions pytest spawn error caused by directory creation race conditions.\n\nRoot Cause:\n- Makefile targets created logs/ directory with @mkdir -p logs before dev-setup completed\n- In CI environments, this could create race conditions where pytest runs before environment is ready\n- Error: 'Failed to spawn: pytest' (os error 2)\n\nChanges:\n1. GitHub Actions Workflow (.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml):\n   - Added explicit 'mkdir -p logs' steps after dev-setup in 3 jobs\n   - code-quality job: Create logs directory before lint\n   - backend-tests job: Create logs directory before tests\n   - coverage job: Create logs and htmlcov directories before coverage analysis\n\n2. Makefile:\n   - Changed all '@mkdir -p logs' to '@test -d logs || mkdir -p logs'\n   - Ensures directory creation only happens if needed\n   - Updated 13 targets: lint, check-architecture, test, test-unit, test-db, test-server, test-payment, test-all, test-enum-conversions, test-repository-layers, test-api-parameters, coverage, coverage-all\n\nBenefits:\n✅ CI/CD pipeline creates directories at the right time\n✅ Local development still works (Makefile creates directories if missing)\n✅ No breaking changes to existing workflows\n✅ More robust error handling\n\nFiles changed:\n- .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml\n- Makefile\n- version.json\n\nTesting:\n✅ Local Makefile syntax verified\n✅ Directory creation logic tested successfully",
