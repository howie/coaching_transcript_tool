  "description": "Production Deployment Fixes: Chunk Loading & Google OAuth",
  "releaseDate": "2025-10-03",
  "releaseNotes": "Critical production fixes for deployment and authentication: (1) Fixed 404 chunk loading errors by stabilizing BUILD_ID generation - now uses Git SHA instead of unstable timestamp; (2) Added chunk verification script to prevent broken deployments - validates all Next.js chunks exist in OpenNext output before deployment; (3) Enhanced deployment workflow with automatic clean builds and verification steps; (4) Fixed Google OAuth login failures by implementing Next.js middleware with proper CSP headers allowing Google authentication domains; (5) Updated backend OAuth to use configurable FRONTEND_URL instead of hardcoded URLs for multi-domain support; (6) Created comprehensive documentation for Google OAuth setup and deployment procedures; (7) All fixes tested and verified with production-ready deployment process.",
