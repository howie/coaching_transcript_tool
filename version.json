  "releaseDate": "2025-09-04",
  "releaseNotes": "Fixed final missing environment variable blocking production startup: Added GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID (in addition to existing GCP_PROJECT_ID for compatibility). Application was expecting GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID but Terraform was only providing GCP_PROJECT_ID. Now both services receive the correct Google Cloud project identifier. All environment validation should now pass.",
