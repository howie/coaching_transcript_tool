  "releaseDate": "2025-09-04",
  "releaseNotes": "Fixed deployment path issues by switching from native Python runtime to Docker deployment on Render. The start.sh script was designed for Docker containers (/app paths) but Render was using native runtime where /app doesn't exist. Now using Dockerfile.api and worker Dockerfile for consistent containerized deployment environment.",
