  "description": "Hotfix: Google OAuth CSP Middleware Exclusion",
  "releaseDate": "2025-10-03",
  "releaseNotes": "Critical hotfix for Google OAuth login failures caused by CSP conflicts. Fixed by excluding Google OAuth routes (api/proxy/v1/auth/google/*) from Next.js CSP middleware matcher. This prevents our CSP headers from conflicting with Google's authentication page CSP, allowing inline scripts to execute properly. Also added comprehensive staging environment plan for future testing with new domain architecture (staging.coachly.tw).",
