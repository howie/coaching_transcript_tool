# Storage Bucket Simplification Worktree

## Purpose
Isolated environment for implementing the storage bucket simplification plan as part of WP6 Clean Architecture migration.

## Branch Details
- **Base Branch**: `feature/ca-lite/wp6`
- **Feature Branch**: `feature/ca-lite/wp6-storage-simplification`
- **Worktree Path**: `/Users/howie/Workspace/github/coaching_transcript_tool/.worktrees/ca-lite/wp6-storage-simplification`

## Scope of Changes
This worktree is dedicated to implementing a significant infrastructure change that will:

1. **Remove TRANSCRIPT_STORAGE_BUCKET dependency** from codebase
2. **Update Google STT service** to use audio bucket for batch operation results
3. **Remove transcript bucket configurations** from environment and deployment
4. **Update documentation** to reflect the simplified architecture

## Key Files to Modify
- `src/coaching_assistant/services/google_stt.py` - Update batch operation configuration
- `src/coaching_assistant/config/settings.py` - Remove transcript bucket settings
- `.env.example` - Remove transcript bucket environment variables
- Documentation files related to storage configuration
- Infrastructure/deployment configurations

## Environment Setup
- ✅ Python virtual environment created and activated
- ✅ Dependencies installed from requirements.txt
- ✅ Environment template copied (.env.example → .env)
- ✅ Git worktree properly configured

## Benefits of Isolated Development
- Safe environment to implement breaking infrastructure changes
- No interference with ongoing WP6 development work
- Easy rollback if implementation encounters issues
- Clear separation of concerns for this specific infrastructure change

## Next Steps
1. Analyze current TRANSCRIPT_STORAGE_BUCKET usage across codebase
2. Plan migration strategy for Google STT batch operations
3. Implement changes incrementally with proper testing
4. Update configuration and documentation
5. Test thoroughly before merging back to main WP6 branch
