# E2E Test Status

## Current Issues

The E2E tests in `test_plan_upgrade_e2e.py` were created but **are not currently executable** due to the following issues:

### 1. Incorrect API Endpoints
Many endpoints referenced in the tests don't exist in the actual implementation:

**Tests Reference (Incorrect):**
- `/api/v1/plans/current` 
- `/api/v1/plans/upgrade`
- `/api/v1/usage/current-month`
- `/api/v1/usage/status`
- `/api/v1/sessions`
- `/api/v1/sessions/{id}/export`

**Actual Endpoints (Correct):**
- `/api/v1/plans/current`
- `/api/usage/current-month` (needs implementation)
- `/api/v1/sessions`
- `/api/v1/sessions/{id}/transcript`
- `/api/v1/plan/validate-action` (this one exists)
- `/api/v1/plan/current-usage` (this one exists)

### 2. Missing Mock Dependencies
The tests attempt to use Stripe mocks but the payment integration isn't implemented yet.

### 3. Missing API Endpoints
Some endpoints referenced in the tests need to be implemented:
- Plan upgrade endpoint
- Usage status endpoint
- Export validation by format

## How to Fix

1. **Update all endpoint paths** in the test file to match actual API routes
2. **Implement missing endpoints** or remove tests for non-existent features
3. **Add proper test fixtures** for authentication and user setup
4. **Mock external dependencies** properly (Stripe, etc.)

## Test Coverage Status

| Test Type | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Unit Tests | ✅ Working | Basic tests pass |
| Integration Tests | ⚠️ Partial | Need endpoint fixes |
| Performance Tests | ⚠️ Partial | Need real data fixtures |
| E2E Tests | ❌ Not Working | Need major fixes |

## Recommendation

For now, rely on:
1. **Unit tests** for individual components
2. **API tests** in `tests/api/` directory which are working
3. **Manual testing** via the frontend application

The E2E tests serve as **documentation of intended user flows** but need significant work to be executable.
