Build a public-facing SaaS web application landing page and dashboard for a product called **CoachAssistant**, under the brand **Doxa Studio**.

This site is hosted at `service.doxa.com.tw`. It provides AI-powered coaching tools for ICF coaches at every stage – from learning to becoming a certified professional coach.

---

🌐 Internationalization (i18n)
• The site must support two languages:
  - Default: **繁體中文**
  - Toggle: English (🇬🇧)
• A language switcher should be placed at the top-right corner
• All text on landing page and dashboard pages must use a translation object (not hardcoded)
• Recommended i18n approach: JSON translation files or language context provider (for React)

---

🔐 Access & Authentication
• Home page does not require login.
• A future Login with Google SSO (OAuth2) button should be shown (disabled or placeholder).
• Once logged in (mock state is fine), show user name/email and a Logout button in top-right corner.

---

🎨 Brand & Theme
• Dark theme inspired by Doxa Studio:
  - Background: Deep Blue `#1C2E4A`
  - Highlight: Warm Yellow `#F5C451`
  - Text: White or Light Gray
  - Font: Noto Sans / Helvetica Neue
• Layout reference: Similar to Render.com dashboard
• Responsive for mobile and tablet views
