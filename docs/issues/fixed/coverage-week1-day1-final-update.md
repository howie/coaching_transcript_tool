     - ClientOptionsUseCase (3 tests)
   - File: test_client_management_error_handling.py

#### Failed/Blocked Modules ❌

**usage_tracking_use_case.py** - Cannot be tested due to architectural issues:

1. **CreateUsageLogUseCase** - Broken domain model usage
   - Attempts to create UsageLog with non-existent fields: `client_id`, `duration_seconds`, `cost_usd`, `is_billable`, etc.
   - Domain model only has: `id`, `session_id`, `user_id`, `duration_minutes`, `transcription_type`, `billable`, `cost_cents`
   - **Impact**: Production code cannot work as written

2. **GetUserUsageUseCase** - Missing repository methods
   - Calls `usage_log_repo.get_usage_summary()` which doesn't exist
   - **Impact**: Cannot test without implementing missing methods

3. **Session Domain Model** - Incomplete
   - Use case expects `provider_metadata` field
   - Domain model doesn't have this field
   - **Workaround**: Tests use dynamic attributes (not sustainable)

## Key Findings

### Critical Production Issues Discovered 🔴

1. **usage_tracking_use_case.py is fundamentally broken**
   - Domain models and use cases are severely out of sync
   - Code cannot execute successfully in production
   - Requires architectural refactoring before testing is viable

2. **Repository port/implementation mismatches**
   - Use cases calling methods that don't exist in repository contracts
   - Indicates incomplete Clean Architecture implementation

### Architectural Insights 💡

1. **Test-Driven Discovery Works**
   - Writing error path tests revealed production bugs
   - ROI: Finding critical bugs > Coverage percentage alone

2. **Clean Architecture Violations**
   - Domain models should be stable
   - Use cases creating entities with non-existent fields = broken abstraction
   - Repository ports incomplete

3. **Testing Prioritization Needed**
   - Focus on working modules first
   - Fix broken modules before testing them
   - Alternative: Skip broken modules in coverage targets

## Test Quality Metrics

### Error Path Coverage ✅
All 64 new tests focus on error handling:
- Database failures (IntegrityError, OperationalError)
- Validation errors (negative values, missing entities)
- Authorization checks (ownership verification)
- Edge cases (zero values, empty results, boundary conditions)

### Test Categories Implemented

1. **Database Error Handling** (20 tests)
   - Connection timeouts
   - Query failures
   - Integrity violations
   - Concurrent save attempts

2. **Validation Errors** (18 tests)
   - Missing coach/client entities
   - Negative duration/fee amounts
   - Business rule violations
   - Authorization failures

3. **Edge Cases** (20 tests)
   - Zero fee sessions (pro bono)
   - Empty result sets
   - Invalid page numbers
   - Currency normalization
   - Partial updates

4. **Helper Function Edge Cases** (6 tests)
   - Invalid plan types
   - Zero/negative file sizes
   - Case-insensitive format validation
   - None/empty string handling

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Exceptionally Well ✅

1. **Systematic use case testing**
   - Testing each use case class separately = clear coverage
   - 100% test pass rate on both modules
   - No architecture issues (unlike usage_tracking)

2. **Mock-based error testing**
   - Database error simulation effective
   - Repository mocking patterns reusable
   - Fast execution (~7 seconds for 670 tests)

3. **Exceeding targets consistently**
   - coaching_session: Target 60%, Achieved 68%
   - client_management: Target 60%, Achieved 62%
   - Shows efficient test design

4. **Error-first approach**
   - Focusing on exception paths revealed critical issues
   - Higher value than happy path testing initially

### What Didn't Work ❌

1. **Testing broken code**
   - 2 hours spent discovering usage_tracking_use_case.py is broken
   - Cannot test code that doesn't work
   - Should have verified basic functionality first

2. **Coverage-first mindset**
   - Initial plan focused on "18% → 60%" target
   - Didn't account for untestable code
   - Should prioritize code quality > coverage number

### Revised Approach 📋

1. **Module Health Check First**
   - Verify basic functionality before writing tests
   - Check domain model alignment with use cases
   - Confirm repository methods exist

2. **Focus on Working Modules**
   - Skip modules with architectural issues
   - Target modules that can achieve 60%+ quickly
   - Return to broken modules after fixing

3. **Document Issues Separately**
   - Architecture issues ≠ test failures
   - Create fix backlog for broken code
   - Update coverage plan to focus on testable code

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Day 2)

1. **Continue with working modules**:
   - transcript_upload_use_case.py: 20% → 50% (verify testability first)
   - session_management_use_case.py: 16% → 40% (already at 73%, expand coverage)
   - billing_analytics_use_case.py: 34% → 55% (likely testable)

2. **Architecture fix backlog** (separate from coverage work):
   - Issue: UsageLog domain model incomplete
   - Issue: Repository port methods missing
   - Issue: Session model missing provider_metadata
   - Priority: High (blocks payment/billing coverage)

### Revised Week 1 Plan

**Original**:
- Days 1-3: usage_tracking_use_case.py 18% → 60% ❌

**Revised** (Based on Day 1 success):
- ✅ **Day 1 Complete**:
  - coaching_session_management_use_case.py: 20% → 68%
  - client_management_use_case.py: 20% → 62%
  - Overall: 46.36% → 47.04%

- **Days 2-3**: Continue with testable modules
  - transcript_upload_use_case.py: 20% → 50%
  - session_management_use_case.py: 73% → 85%
  - billing_analytics_use_case.py: 34% → 55%

- **Days 4-5**: Analytics & Review
  - Additional edge case coverage for completed modules
  - Integration test scenarios
  - Documentation and lessons learned

- **Skip**: usage_tracking_use_case.py until architecture fixed
