# Mixed Content Error Tracking Document

## Issue Summary
**Problem**: Frontend repeatedly making HTTP requests to API server instead of HTTPS, causing Mixed Content errors
**First Reported**: 2025-09-05
**Status**: UNRESOLVED - Multiple fix attempts have failed
**Impact**: Critical - Blocks API functionality on production (https://coachly.doxa.com.tw)

## Error Details

### Browser Console Errors
```
Mixed Content: The page at 'https://coachly.doxa.com.tw/dashboard/billing' was loaded over HTTPS, 
but requested an insecure resource 'http://api.doxa.com.tw/api/health/'. 
This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.
```

### Affected Endpoints
- `/api/health/` - Health check endpoint
- ECPay status check endpoints
- All API calls from frontend to backend

## Environment Information

### Current Deployment
- **Frontend URL**: https://coachly.doxa.com.tw
- **API URL (Expected)**: https://api.doxa.com.tw
- **API URL (Actual in Error)**: http://api.doxa.com.tw (HTTP instead of HTTPS)
- **Cloudflare Workers Version**: 28d263fc-9a1e-4f9e-806d-70067008e642 (2025-09-05 13:32 UTC)

### Configuration Files
- `.env.production`: Contains `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.doxa.com.tw` ‚úÖ
- `Makefile`: Sets `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.doxa.com.tw` during deployment ‚úÖ
- `.open-next/cloudflare/next-env.mjs`: Shows correct HTTPS URL in build ‚úÖ

## Previous Fix Attempts

### Attempt 1: Environment Variable Configuration
**Date**: 2025-09-04
**Actions Taken**:
- Updated `.env.production` to use HTTPS URL
- Modified Makefile to explicitly set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.doxa.com.tw`
**Result**: ‚ùå Failed - Error persists

### Attempt 2: API Client HTTPS Enforcement
**Date**: 2025-09-04
**Actions Taken**:
- Added HTTPS enforcement logic in `lib/api.ts` (lines 192-201)
- Checks for secure context and forces HTTPS replacement
- Additional check for doxa.com.tw domain
**Code**:
```typescript
// Force HTTPS in secure contexts to prevent Mixed Content errors
if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.protocol === 'https:' && baseUrl.startsWith('http://')) {
  baseUrl = baseUrl.replace('http://', 'https://')
  debugLog('Forced HTTPS for secure context:', baseUrl)
}

// Additional safety check: always use HTTPS for doxa.com.tw domain
if (baseUrl.includes('doxa.com.tw') && !baseUrl.startsWith('https://')) {
  baseUrl = baseUrl.replace(/^http:\/\//, 'https://')
  debugLog('Forced HTTPS for doxa.com.tw domain:', baseUrl)
}
```
**Result**: ‚ùå Failed - Error persists

### Attempt 3: Build Configuration Updates
**Date**: 2025-09-05
**Actions Taken**:
- Updated build process to ensure environment variables are embedded
- Verified build output contains correct HTTPS URLs
**Result**: ‚ùå Failed - Error persists

### Attempt 4: Makefile Enhancement
**Date**: 2025-09-05
**Actions Taken**:
- Enhanced Makefile to explicitly display API URL during deployment
- Added clear indicators showing configuration being used
**Result**: ‚ùå Failed - Error persists despite correct configuration display

## Technical Analysis

### Verified Working
1. ‚úÖ Environment variables are correctly set in configuration files
2. ‚úÖ Build process includes correct HTTPS URLs
3. ‚úÖ Defensive HTTPS enforcement code is in place
4. ‚úÖ Build artifacts contain correct URLs (verified in `.open-next/cloudflare/next-env.mjs`)

### Potential Root Causes
1. **Runtime Environment Variable Override**: Cloudflare Workers might be overriding or not receiving environment variables
2. **Client-Side Initialization Timing**: API client might be initialized before environment variables are available
3. **Service Binding Issue**: If using Cloudflare service bindings, the configuration might be different
4. **Build vs Runtime Mismatch**: Environment variables set during build might not be available at runtime
5. **Cache Issues**: CDN or browser caching old JavaScript with HTTP URLs

## Observations

### Key Finding
Despite all configuration showing HTTPS, the runtime JavaScript in the browser is still using HTTP. This suggests:
- The issue is not in the source code or build configuration
- The problem occurs between build and runtime execution
- Cloudflare Workers environment might not be properly injecting environment variables

### Evidence from Build
```bash
# .open-next/cloudflare/next-env.mjs shows:
export const production = {"NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL":"https://api.doxa.com.tw",...}
```
But runtime still uses HTTP.

## Next Steps - Hotfix Plan

### Immediate Actions
1. Create hotfix branch: `hotfix/mixed-content-api-url`
2. Implement hardcoded HTTPS fallback as temporary fix
3. Add runtime diagnostics to understand environment variable availability

### Investigation Areas
1. **Cloudflare Workers Environment**:
   - Check `wrangler.toml` for environment variable configuration
   - Verify if Cloudflare Workers requires special configuration for runtime env vars
   - Test with Cloudflare Workers secrets/variables

2. **Runtime Diagnostics**:
   - Add console logging to show actual environment variables at runtime
   - Log API client initialization to understand when/how URL is set
   - Add diagnostic endpoint to verify configuration

3. **Alternative Solutions**:
   - Hardcode HTTPS URL for production domain (temporary fix)
   - Use relative URLs and let browser handle protocol
   - Implement API proxy through Cloudflare Workers

### Proposed Permanent Fix
```typescript
// In lib/api.ts constructor
constructor() {
  // ... existing code ...
  
  // HOTFIX: Force HTTPS for production regardless of environment variables
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && 
      (window.location.hostname === 'coachly.doxa.com.tw' || 
       window.location.hostname === 'doxa.com.tw')) {
    this.baseUrl = 'https://api.doxa.com.tw'
    console.warn('HOTFIX: Forcing HTTPS API URL for production domain')
    return
  }
  
  // ... rest of existing initialization ...
}
```

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment first
- [ ] Verify no Mixed Content errors in browser console
- [ ] Test health check endpoint
- [ ] Test ECPay status check
- [ ] Test actual API calls (login, session creation)
- [ ] Check both coachly.doxa.com.tw and doxa.com.tw domains
- [ ] Verify in multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)

### Attempt 5: Hotfix Branch with Hardcoded HTTPS
**Date**: 2025-09-05 21:45
**Branch**: `hotfix/mixed-content-api-url`
**Actions Taken**:
- Created hotfix branch specifically for this issue
- Added hardcoded HTTPS check at the very beginning of APIClient constructor
- Added console warning to verify hotfix is active
- Deployed using `make deploy-frontend`

**Code Added**:
```typescript
// HOTFIX: Force HTTPS for production domains to prevent Mixed Content errors
if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && 
    (window.location.hostname === 'coachly.doxa.com.tw' || 
     window.location.hostname === 'doxa.com.tw')) {
  this.fetcher = window.fetch.bind(window)
  this.baseUrl = 'https://api.doxa.com.tw'
  console.warn('üîí HOTFIX: Forcing HTTPS API URL for production domain:', this.baseUrl)
  return
}
```

**Result**: ‚ùå **FAILED** - No change observed
- Mixed Content error persists
- Hotfix console warning not visible
- **CRITICAL**: This suggests the deployed version is NOT using our updated code

## Critical Analysis - Deployment Issue

**Key Finding**: The hotfix code is not being executed, which indicates:

1. **Deployment Problem**: The `make deploy-frontend` command may not be deploying our hotfix branch
2. **Version Mismatch**: Production might still be using an old cached version
3. **Build Process Issue**: The updated code might not be included in the build output

**Evidence**:
- Console shows old file hashes (117-ce57a730decb5c44.js, 358-9761035d7e957884.js)
- No hotfix warning message visible
- Same exact error pattern as before

**Immediate Investigation Needed**:
1. Verify which branch/commit is actually deployed
2. Check if build process includes our changes
3. Examine Cloudflare Workers version management

### Attempt 6: Lazy Initialization + Emergency Hotfix (SUCCESSFUL)
**Date**: 2025-09-05 22:15
**Branch**: `hotfix/mixed-content-api-url`
**Actions Taken**:
1. **Implemented lazy initialization** - baseUrl determined at runtime, not at module load time
2. **Added emergency hotfix in healthCheck()** - Direct HTTPS enforcement in the specific method
3. **Created comprehensive unit tests** - 10 security tests to ensure HTTPS enforcement

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Lazy initialization pattern
private _baseUrl: string | null = null

public getBaseUrl(): string {
  if (this._baseUrl === null) {
    // HOTFIX: Determine base URL at runtime
    if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.protocol === 'https:') {
      this._baseUrl = 'https://api.doxa.com.tw'
      console.warn('üîí RUNTIME HOTFIX: Using HTTPS API URL for secure context:', this._baseUrl)
    }
    // ... other logic
  }
  return this._baseUrl
}

// Emergency hotfix in healthCheck
async healthCheck() {
  let url = `${this.baseUrl}/api/health`
  if (typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.location.protocol === 'https:') {
    url = url.replace('http://', 'https://')
    console.warn('üöë EMERGENCY HOTFIX: Forced HTTPS for health check:', url)
  }
  // ... rest of method
}
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ **SUCCESS** - Mixed Content errors resolved!

**Evidence**:
- Console shows runtime hotfix warnings: `üîí RUNTIME HOTFIX: Using HTTPS API URL for secure context`
- Emergency hotfix working: `üöë EMERGENCY HOTFIX: Forced HTTPS for health check`
- All 10 unit tests pass, confirming security measures work correctly

## Root Cause Analysis - Final Conclusion

**Why Dev worked but Prod failed:**

1. **Protocol Mismatch**:
   - Dev: `http://localhost:3000` ‚Üí `http://localhost:8000` ‚úÖ (Both HTTP)
   - Prod: `https://coachly.doxa.com.tw` ‚Üí `http://api.doxa.com.tw` ‚ùå (HTTPS ‚Üí HTTP = Mixed Content)

2. **JavaScript Module Loading Timing**:
   - Dev: Dynamic reloading, window object fully available
   - Prod: Static build, APIClient initialized before window.location fully ready

3. **Environment Variables vs Runtime Context**:
   - Environment variables were correct in build output
   - Problem was initialization timing in Cloudflare Workers environment

## Solution: Dual-Layer Security

**Layer 1: Lazy Initialization** - Defers URL determination until first API call
**Layer 2: Emergency Hotfix** - Direct HTTPS replacement in critical methods

This ensures HTTPS is enforced regardless of initialization timing issues.

## Security Tests Added

Created comprehensive unit tests (`__tests__/api/https-security.test.tsx`):
- Runtime HTTPS enforcement (3 tests)
- Health check HTTPS enforcement (2 tests) 
- Mixed Content prevention (1 test)
- Console warning verification (2 tests)
- Edge cases (1 test)
- Integration consistency (1 test)

**All 10/10 tests pass** ‚úÖ
