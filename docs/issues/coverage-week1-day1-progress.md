# Test Coverage Improvement - Week 1, Day 1 Progress

**Date**: 2025-10-04
**Focus**: Payment & Billing Critical Path - `usage_tracking_use_case.py`
**Goal**: 18% → 60% coverage

## What We Did

### 1. Test Infrastructure Setup ✅
- Created new test file: `tests/unit/core/services/test_usage_tracking_error_handling.py`
- Set up comprehensive error handling test framework
- Established mocking patterns for repositories

### 2. Error Scenarios Implemented
Created 18 error handling tests covering:

**Database Failure Scenarios**:
- User not found (ValueError expected)
- Database errors on user fetch
- Database errors on usage log save
- Concurrent save attempts (race conditions)
- Parent log retrieval errors

**Edge Cases**:
- Missing session attributes
- Invalid cost calculations
- Zero duration sessions
- Extremely large duration (24 hours)
- Negative duration values

**GetUserUsage Error Handling**:
- Database errors when fetching usage
- Empty results handling
- Missing user handling

**PlanLimits Edge Cases**:
- Invalid plan types
- Zero file size
- Negative file size
- Case-insensitive format validation
- Empty format string
- None format handling

### 3. Current Test Results
- **Passing**: 9/18 tests (50%)
- **Failing**: 6 tests (fixture issues)
- **Errors**: 3 tests (implementation mismatches)

## Issues Discovered

### Technical Debt Found:
1. **provider_metadata attribute**: Not in Session domain model but expected by use case
   - Workaround: Added as dynamic attribute in test fixtures
   - **Action needed**: Align domain model with use case expectations

2. **GetUserUsageUseCase signature**: Tests expect different method signature
   - Issue: Repository initialization mismatch
   - **Action needed**: Review actual implementation vs interface

3. **Mock behavior complexity**: Some tests need more sophisticated mocking
   - User counter updates
   - Transaction handling
   - Error propagation

## Lessons Learned

1. **Error path testing reveals implementation gaps**
   - Tests are finding actual architectural misalignments
   - This is valuable - we're improving code quality, not just coverage

2. **Test setup is iterative**
   - Initial 18 tests took ~1 hour
   - Each test requires careful consideration of:
     - Repository behavior
     - Domain model state
     - Error propagation
     - Business rule enforcement

3. **Coverage improvement is non-linear**
   - 18 tests likely add only 5-10% coverage
   - Need ~90 tests for 18% → 60% target
   - Confirms 2-3 day estimate for this module

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. Fix failing tests (repository signature issues)
2. Add provider_metadata to Session model or use getattr consistently
3. Get all 18 tests passing

### Short-term (This Week)
1. Add 30+ more error handling tests for:
   - Update user usage counters error paths
   - Calculate cost edge cases
   - Retry logic error handling
   - Billing validation errors

2. Add integration tests for:
   - Complete usage tracking flow
   - Error recovery scenarios
   - Transaction rollback handling

### Coverage Projection
- **Today's tests** (when fixed): ~20-25% coverage (+2-7%)
- **Week 1 target**: 60% coverage
- **Remaining work**: ~70 more tests needed

## Time Investment
- **Planning & setup**: 30 min
- **Test implementation**: 60 min  
- **Debugging & iteration**: 45 min (ongoing)
- **Total so far**: 2h 15min
- **Estimated to complete module**: 6-8 hours (2-3 days as planned)

## Conclusion

✅ **On track** - We've validated the approach and timeline
✅ **Finding real issues** - Tests are improving code quality
✅ **Learned mocking patterns** - Can accelerate remaining tests
⚠️ **Need alignment** - Domain model vs use case expectations

The 3-week plan to 85% coverage is feasible but requires:
- Dedicated time commitment
- Iterative refinement
- Addressing technical debt as discovered

**Recommendation**: Continue with systematic approach, fixing tests as we go, documenting patterns for reuse.
