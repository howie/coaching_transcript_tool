- **Requirements**:
  - Automatic token refresh before expiration
  - Proper error handling for expired tokens
  - Seamless user experience during refresh
  - Logout on refresh failure
  - Token storage security

### 6. Supporting Backend APIs
Create necessary backend endpoints for frontend features:
- **Photo Upload**: File upload endpoint with storage integration
- **Payment Settings**: ECPay integration for payment method management
- **Session Updates**: API for saving transcript edits
- **Usage Data**: Real-time usage statistics API

## E2E Demonstration Workflow
