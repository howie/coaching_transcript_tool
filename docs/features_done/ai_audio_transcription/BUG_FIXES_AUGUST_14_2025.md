# AI Audio Transcription Bug Fixes - August 14, 2025

## üéØ Critical Issue: Speaker Role Mapping System Inconsistencies

### Problem Summary
Multiple critical bugs were affecting the speaker role assignment system across both subtitle upload and automatic transcription workflows, causing user-selected roles to be incorrectly overridden or ignored.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Subtitle Upload Role Mapping Failure
**Problem**: User-selected speaker roles (coach/client) during subtitle upload were being overridden when the frontend refetched transcript data, causing all speakers to become "client".

**Root Cause**: Frontend and backend used different speaker key normalization algorithms:
- **Frontend**: `speakerName.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '_').replace(/[^\w_]/g, '')`
- **Backend**: `speaker_name.lower().replace(' ', '_')` (only replaced spaces)

**Example Failure**:
- Frontend generated: `speaker_howie_yu` 
- Backend generated: `speaker_howie yu` (space not handled)
- Result: Key mismatch ‚Üí role mapping failed ‚Üí default to 'client'

### Issue 2: Frontend/Backend Role System Inconsistency
**Problem**: Frontend used numeric speaker IDs (COACH: 0, CLIENT: 1) while backend expected different convention (1=coach, 2=client).

**Root Cause**: Mixed conventions led to confusion and incorrect role assignments after transcript processing.

### Issue 3: Celery Transcription Task Role Assignment Failure
**Problem**: AssemblyAI transcription results weren't properly converting speaker IDs and role assignments weren't being persisted to the database.

**Root Causes**:
- `_convert_speaker_id()` mapped "A"‚Üí0, "B"‚Üí1, but frontend expected 1-based IDs
- Role assignments only stored in provider_metadata, not accessible to frontend APIs
- Missing SessionRole database records for automatic role assignments

## üõ†Ô∏è Comprehensive Solutions Implemented

### 1. Speaker Key Normalization Unification
**Backend Changes** (`coaching_sessions.py`):
```python
# OLD (inconsistent)
speaker_key = f"speaker_{speaker_name.lower().replace(' ', '_')}"

# NEW (matches frontend)
normalized_name = re.sub(r'[^\w_]', '', speaker_name.lower().replace(' ', '_'))
speaker_key = f"speaker_{normalized_name}"
```

**Applied to**:
- VTT parser (both `<v>` format and prefix format)
- SRT parser (prefix format)
- Ensures consistent speaker key generation across all subtitle formats

### 2. Role System Migration to String Enums
**Frontend Changes** (`page.tsx`):
```typescript
// OLD (numeric IDs - confusing)
const SPEAKER_IDS = {
  COACH: 0,
  CLIENT: 1
} as const;

// NEW (string enums - clear)
const SPEAKER_ROLES = {
  COACH: 'coach' as const,
  CLIENT: 'client' as const
} as const;
```

**Updated Functions**:
- `getSpeakerRoleFromId` ‚Üí `getSpeakerRoleFromSegment`
- Prioritizes segment.role field when available
- Falls back to role_assignments or numeric convention
- All role detection logic now uses string enums

**Backend Enhancement**:
- VTT/SRT parsers now generate both `speaker_id` (backward compatibility) and `speaker_role` (new standard)
- Segments include role information for direct frontend consumption

### 3. Celery Task Role Assignment Architecture Overhaul
**AssemblyAI Provider Fixes** (`assemblyai_stt.py`):
```python
# OLD (0-based mapping)
def _convert_speaker_id(self, speaker_id) -> int:
    return ord(speaker_id.upper()) - ord('A')  # "A"‚Üí0, "B"‚Üí1

# NEW (1-based mapping matching convention)
def _convert_speaker_id(self, speaker_id) -> int:
    return ord(speaker_id.upper()) - ord('A') + 1  # "A"‚Üí1, "B"‚Üí2
```

**New Role Persistence System** (`transcription_tasks.py`):
```python
def _save_speaker_role_assignments(db: Session, session_id: UUID, provider_metadata: dict):
    """Save speaker role assignments from provider metadata to SessionRole table"""
    role_assignments = provider_metadata.get('speaker_role_assignments', {})
    
    for speaker_id, role_str in role_assignments.items():
        speaker_role = SpeakerRole.COACH if role_str == 'coach' else SpeakerRole.CLIENT
        session_role = SessionRole(
            session_id=session_id,
            speaker_id=int(speaker_id),
            role=speaker_role
        )
        db.add(session_role)
```

### 4. Database Role Record Creation
**Subtitle Upload Flow**:
- Creates SessionRole records during VTT/SRT parsing
- Preserves user-selected role assignments in database
- Links to transcription session for API retrieval

**Audio Transcription Flow**:
- Extracts role assignments from SimpleRoleAssigner results in provider_metadata
- Creates SessionRole records during Celery task completion
- Enables frontend API access to automatic role assignments

### 5. Backend API Error Fixes
**Missing Variable Fix** (`coaching_sessions.py`):
```python
# Fixed missing transcription_session_summary variable
transcription_session_summary = get_transcription_session_summary(db, session.transcription_session_id)
```

**Import Error Fix** (`sessions.py`):
```python
# OLD (incorrect import)
from datetime import datetime

# NEW (complete import)
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
```
