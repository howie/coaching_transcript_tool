## Story
**As a** coach  
**I want to** link audio uploads to my coaching sessions and create new sessions from transcripts  
**So that** I can seamlessly manage both session records and their transcripts in one integrated workflow

## Priority: P1 (High)

## Background Context

### Current System Architecture

## Technical Implementation - COMPLETED ✅

### Frontend Architecture Implemented

```typescript
// Three-tab layout with comprehensive session management
type TabType = 'overview' | 'transcript' | 'analysis';

// Key interfaces implemented
interface SpeakingStats {
  coach_speaking_time: number;
  client_speaking_time: number;
  coach_percentage: number;
  client_percentage: number;
  silence_time: number;
}

interface TranscriptData {
  session_id: string;
  duration_sec: number;
  segments: TranscriptSegment[];
}
```

### API Integration Utilized

```typescript
// Existing endpoints leveraged for integration
GET /api/v1/sessions/{session_id}                    // Session details
GET /api/v1/sessions/{session_id}/transcript?format  // Transcript export
GET /api/v1/sessions/{session_id}/status            // Processing status
GET /api/v1/coaching-sessions/{session_id}          // Coaching session data
PUT /api/v1/coaching-sessions/{session_id}          // Session updates

// Real-time status tracking implemented via:
- useTranscriptionStatus hook for progress polling
- Automatic transcript fetching on completion
- Export functionality for all supported formats
```

### Frontend Components Implemented

```typescript
// Comprehensive session detail page with three tabs
<SessionDetailPage>
  <OverviewTab>
    <BasicInfoCard />           // Editable session information
    <AudioAnalysisCard />       // Upload, progress, speaking stats
  </OverviewTab>
  
  <TranscriptTab>
    <TranscriptTable />         // Table view with timestamps, speakers
    <ExportControls />          // VTT, SRT, TXT, JSON export
    <ProcessingStatus />        // Real-time progress indicator
  </TranscriptTab>
  
  <AIAnalysisTab>
    <AISummaryGenerator />      // Generate coaching session summary
    <AIChatInterface />         // Interactive Q&A about session
  </AIAnalysisTab>
</SessionDetailPage>
```

### Integration Logic Implemented

```typescript
// Real-time status tracking and data synchronization
const {
  status: transcriptionStatus,
  session: transcriptionSession
} = useTranscriptionStatus(session?.audio_timeseq_id);

// Speaking statistics calculation
const calculateSpeakingStats = (segments: TranscriptSegment[]): SpeakingStats => {
  // Coach vs Client speaking time analysis
  // Visual progress bars for time distribution
  // Comprehensive session analytics
};

// AI-powered analysis features
const generateAISummary = async () => {
  // Session summary generation
  // Interactive chat functionality
  // Coaching insights and recommendations
};
```

## User Experience Flow

### Flow 1: Audio Upload with Session Linking
```
1. Coach uploads audio file (US001)
2. Upload form shows "Link to existing session?" dropdown
3. Coach selects recent coaching session OR chooses "Create new session later"
4. If linked: CoachingSession.transcript_status = 'processing'
5. Transcription proceeds normally (US002, US003)
6. On completion: CoachingSession.transcript_status = 'completed'
```

### Flow 2: Session Detail Three-Tab Experience ✅
```
1. Coach clicks "View Details" from sessions list
2. Overview Tab: View/edit basic info + audio analysis with speaking ratios
3. Transcript Tab: Table view of conversation with export options
4. AI Analysis Tab: Generate summary + interactive chat about session
5. Real-time status updates across all tabs during processing
6. Seamless navigation between session management and transcript analysis
```

### Flow 3: Comprehensive Audio Analysis ✅
```
1. Coach uploads audio via session detail or audio-analysis page
2. Real-time progress tracking with TranscriptionProgress component
3. On completion, automatic calculation of:
   - Coach vs Client speaking time percentages
   - Visual progress bars for time distribution
   - Total duration, talking time, silence time statistics
4. Table-based transcript display with timestamps and confidence scores
5. Export functionality for all supported formats (VTT/SRT/TXT/JSON)
```

## Data Relationships

```
User (Coach)
├── CoachingSession (business record)
│   ├── Client (who was coached)
│   ├── Session metadata (date, fee, notes)
│   └── transcript_status (none, processing, completed, failed)
└── Session (audio transcription)
    ├── Audio file and STT processing
    ├── TranscriptSegments (the actual transcript)
    └── coaching_session_id (nullable FK)
```

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Data inconsistency between linked records | Confusion, wrong reports | Atomic transactions, data validation |
| Complex UI with two session types | User confusion | Clear visual distinction, unified dashboard |
| Performance with joined queries | Slow dashboard load | Proper indexing, query optimization |
| Migration complexity for existing data | Deployment issues | Gradual migration, backward compatibility |

## Dependencies
- ✅ US001: Audio Upload (completed)
- ⚠️ US002: Transcription Processing (backend complete, needs frontend)
- ✅ Coaching Session Management (existing system)
- ✅ Client Management (existing system)

## Specification by Example

### Example 1: Link Audio to Existing Session During Upload
**Given** I have a coaching session record for "Alice Chen" on "2025-01-15"  
**And** the session is marked as 60 minutes duration  
**When** I upload an audio file from that same session  
**And** select "Alice Chen - 2025-01-15 - 60min" from the dropdown  
**Then** the audio session should link to the coaching session  
**And** coaching session transcript_status should update to "processing"  
**And** I should see progress on both the transcript page and coaching session page  

### Example 2: Create Coaching Session from Completed Transcript
**Given** I have a completed transcript for a 45-minute audio file  
**And** the transcript shows clear Coach/Client conversation patterns  
**When** I click "Create Session Record" from the transcript page  
**Then** form should pre-fill:  
- Session date: "2025-01-15" (transcript date)
- Duration: "45 minutes" (actual audio duration)
- Notes: "Auto-generated from transcript analysis on 2025-01-15"  
**And** I should select client from dropdown or create new client  
**And** after saving, both records should be linked  

### Example 3: View Transcript from Coaching Session Detail
**Given** I have a coaching session with transcript_status = "completed"  
**When** I navigate to the coaching session detail page  
**Then** I should see a "Transcript" tab  
**When** I click the "Transcript" tab  
**Then** I should see the full transcript with:  
- Speaker labels showing "Coach" and "Alice" (client name)  
- Timeline with clickable timestamps  
- Export buttons for VTT, SRT, TXT formats  
- Processing info: "Language: Traditional Chinese, Duration: 45:32"  

### Example 4: Unified Dashboard View
**Given** I have 3 coaching sessions (2 with transcripts, 1 without)  
**And** 2 standalone transcripts not linked to sessions  
**When** I view my dashboard  
**Then** I should see all 5 items with clear indicators:  
- "✓ Transcript" icon for sessions with transcripts  
- "⏳ Processing" icon for sessions with transcripts in progress  
- "📝 Link to Session" button for standalone transcripts  
- Filter options: "All", "With Transcripts", "Needs Linking"  

### Example 5: Handle Duration Mismatch
**Given** I have a coaching session recorded as "60 minutes"  
**And** I upload a 47-minute audio file from that session  
**When** I link them together  
**Then** system should show warning: "Duration mismatch: Session=60min, Audio=47min"  
**And** offer options: "Update session duration" or "Keep both values"  
**And** if I choose "Update session duration", coaching session should update to 47min  

### Example 6: Concurrent Processing Handling
**Given** I link an audio file to a coaching session  
**And** transcription is in progress  
**When** I view the coaching session detail page  
**Then** I should see transcript_status = "Processing audio..."  
**And** estimated completion time  
**When** transcription completes  
**And** I refresh the page  
**Then** transcript_status should show "Completed"  
**And** "View Transcript" tab should become available
