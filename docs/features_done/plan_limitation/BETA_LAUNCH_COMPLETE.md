   - Transcriptions: 50 (vs final: 200)
   - Minutes: 300 (vs final: 1200)
   - File Size: 100MB (vs final: 200MB)
   ```

4. **✅ End-to-End Testing Passed**
   - All limit enforcement mechanisms tested and working
   - Error handling verified
   - Database constraints confirmed
   - No bypass vulnerabilities found

5. **✅ Monitoring & Alerting Setup**
   - Beta monitoring script created (`scripts/beta_monitoring.py`)
   - Daily usage tracking
   - Cost estimation and alerts
   - User limit violation detection

## 🛡️ Active Protection Systems

### **Cost Control Circuit Breakers**

- Rollback procedures documented

## 📊 Current System Status

**As of Launch (Aug 16, 2025 00:14:30)**:
- **Users**: 8 total (100% on FREE plan)
- **Daily Activity**: 0 new sessions, 0 transcriptions
- **Usage**: All users well within limits
- **Cost**: $0.00 (well within $50 daily limit)
- **Health**: ✅ System operational

## 🚀 Beta Testing Guidelines

### **Safe Usage Patterns**
- **FREE users**: Can safely test with 3 sessions, 5 transcriptions
- **Monitoring frequency**: Every 4 hours during first week
- **Cost tracking**: Automatic with $25 warning, $50 critical alert
- **User feedback**: Collect via support channels

### **Escalation Procedures**
1. **$25 daily cost reached** → Increase monitoring frequency
2. **$50 daily cost reached** → Immediately disable new transcriptions
3. **10+ users hit limits** → Review usage patterns
4. **System performance degrades** → Scale resources

## 📈 Next Steps for Full Launch

### **After Successful Beta (2-4 weeks)**
1. **Increase limits gradually**:
   - FREE: 3→5→10 sessions
   - PRO: 25→50→100 sessions
2. **Add payment integration** (from `@docs/features/payment`)
3. **Enable plan upgrades**
4. **Add usage analytics dashboard** (from `@docs/features/admin`)
