## Why Archive?

These files are archived rather than deleted because:
1. **Historical Context**: They provide detailed context about specific bugs and their solutions
2. **Case Studies**: Serve as real-world examples for training and reference
3. **Audit Trail**: Document the evolution of best practices
4. **Specificity**: Contain project-specific details that may be useful for debugging similar issues
