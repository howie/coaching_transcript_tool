# Epic 1: SSE Infrastructure Foundation

## Epic Overview
**Epic ID**: SSE-E1  
**Priority**: High (Phase 1)  
**Effort**: 12 story points  
**Duration**: 2 weeks  

**As a** system architect  
**I want** to establish Server-Sent Events infrastructure  
**So that** the platform can deliver real-time status updates efficiently

## Business Value
- **Foundation for real-time features**: Enables immediate status updates and future real-time capabilities
- **Performance optimization**: Reduces server load by 85% and improves response times by 93%
- **Scalability improvement**: Increases concurrent user capacity by 5x with same resources
- **User experience enhancement**: Eliminates 1.5-second average delay in status updates

## Success Metrics
### âœ… Primary Criteria
- [ ] **SSE endpoint** streams status events with <200ms connection establishment
- [ ] **Redis pub/sub** delivers messages with <50ms latency
- [ ] **Celery integration** publishes status at all processing milestones
- [ ] **Authentication** validates user access for SSE connections
- [ ] **Resource management** prevents memory leaks and connection buildup

### ðŸ”§ Technical Criteria  
- [ ] **Connection handling** supports 100+ concurrent SSE connections
- [ ] **Message format** follows structured JSON schema for status updates
- [ ] **Error handling** gracefully manages connection failures and reconnects
- [ ] **Performance** adds <5% overhead to transcription processing

### ðŸ“Š Quality Criteria
- [ ] **Test coverage** >95% for SSE utilities and endpoints
- [ ] **Documentation** complete for API endpoints and message formats
- [ ] **Security** proper authentication and session validation

## User Stories

### 1.1: Backend SSE Endpoint
Create Server-Sent Events endpoint for streaming transcription status updates.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- SSE endpoint `/api/v1/sessions/{session_id}/status/stream` returns proper event stream
- Authentication validates session ownership before streaming
- Proper SSE headers set (Cache-Control: no-cache, Connection: keep-alive)
- Connection closes automatically when transcription completes or fails
- Session validation prevents unauthorized access to status streams

### 1.2: Redis Pub/Sub Infrastructure  
Implement Redis publish/subscribe messaging for broadcasting status updates.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- StatusPublisher utility publishes to session-specific channels
- StatusSubscriber utility listens to channels and yields messages
- Message format includes session_id, status, progress, message, timestamp
- Channel naming follows pattern `transcription:status:{session_id}`
- Connection cleanup prevents memory leaks and channel buildup

### 1.3: Celery Task Integration
Integrate status broadcasting into existing transcription processing tasks.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Transcription task publishes status at milestones (10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, 100%)
- Progress messages are descriptive and user-friendly
- Error conditions trigger failure status broadcasts with error details
- Task completion triggers final status update with results
- Status updates include estimated completion time and processing speed

## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints
```python
GET /api/v1/sessions/{session_id}/status/stream
  - Authentication: Required (Bearer token)
  - Response: text/event-stream
  - Headers: Cache-Control: no-cache, Connection: keep-alive
  - Events: JSON status objects with progress and timing data
```

### Database Schema
No database changes required. Existing `processing_status` table provides initial status data.

### Message Format
```json
{
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "status": "processing|completed|failed",
  "progress": 75,
  "message": "Analyzing speech patterns...",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "duration_processed": 450,
  "duration_total": 600,
  "estimated_completion": "2024-01-15T10:32:00Z",
  "processing_speed": 2.1
}
```

### Redis Channel Structure
```
Channel Pattern: transcription:status:{session_id}
Example: transcription:status:123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
Message TTL: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
Max Channels: 1000 concurrent sessions
```

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Existing authentication system for session validation
- Current transcription task infrastructure in Celery
- Redis instance for pub/sub messaging
- Processing status data model

### External Dependencies
- Redis server with pub/sub capability
- FastAPI SSE support (already available)
- Stable network connection for persistent SSE streams

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk 1: Redis Connection Stability
- **Impact**: Medium - SSE streams depend on Redis pub/sub
- **Mitigation**: Connection pooling, retry logic, health monitoring
- **Contingency**: Database polling fallback for Redis failures

### Risk 2: FastAPI SSE Performance
- **Impact**: Low - FastAPI has native SSE support
- **Mitigation**: Load testing, connection limits, memory monitoring
- **Contingency**: Alternative ASGI server if performance issues

### Risk 3: Authentication Complexity
- **Impact**: Medium - SSE auth differs from REST APIs
- **Mitigation**: Reuse existing JWT validation, comprehensive testing
- **Contingency**: Session token authentication as alternative

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- StatusPublisher and StatusSubscriber utilities
- SSE endpoint authentication and authorization
- Message format validation and serialization
- Connection cleanup and resource management

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end Redis pub/sub message flow
- SSE endpoint with real Redis instance
- Celery task broadcasting to SSE endpoint
- Multiple concurrent connections and resource usage

### Performance Tests
- 100 concurrent SSE connections
