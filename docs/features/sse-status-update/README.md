# Real-Time Transcription Status Updates via SSE

## Feature Overview

Replace inefficient 3-second polling mechanism with Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time transcription status updates, improving user experience and reducing server load.

2. [Epic 2: Real-Time Status Updates](./epics/epic2-realtime-updates/README.md)

## Problem Statement

### Current Issues
- **Polling inefficiency**: Clients poll every 3 seconds regardless of status changes
- **Update latency**: Up to 3-second delay in status updates
- **Server load**: Constant polling from multiple clients increases server load
- **Bandwidth waste**: Repeated identical responses consume unnecessary bandwidth

### Impact
- Poor user experience with delayed feedback
- Increased infrastructure costs from unnecessary requests
- Scalability concerns as user base grows
- Suboptimal resource utilization

## Solution Summary

Implement Server-Sent Events (SSE) to provide real-time, push-based status updates for transcription processing.

### Why SSE over WebSocket?
1. **Unidirectional flow**: Status updates only flow server â†’ client
2. **Simpler implementation**: Native browser support, no additional libraries
3. **Auto-reconnection**: Built-in retry mechanism
4. **HTTP/2 compatible**: Works with existing infrastructure
5. **Firewall friendly**: Uses standard HTTP

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative KPIs
- **Latency reduction**: < 100ms update delay (from 3000ms average)
- **Request reduction**: 95% fewer HTTP requests per session
- **Bandwidth savings**: 80% reduction in status update traffic
- **Connection stability**: > 99.5% uptime for SSE connections

### Qualitative Indicators
- Immediate visual feedback during transcription
- Smoother progress bar updates
- Reduced perceived wait time
- Higher user satisfaction scores

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Browser compatibility**: Some older browsers don't support SSE
- **Proxy/CDN issues**: Cloudflare configuration may need adjustment
- **Connection limits**: Render.com connection pool constraints

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement polling fallback for unsupported browsers
- Configure Cloudflare for SSE pass-through
- Connection pooling and cleanup strategies
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting

## Timeline

- **Phase 1** (Week 1-2): Backend SSE infrastructure
- **Phase 2** (Week 2-3): Frontend integration
- **Phase 3** (Week 3-4): Reliability and fallback mechanisms
- **Phase 4** (Week 4): Monitoring and optimization
