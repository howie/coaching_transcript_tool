## Acceptance Testing Flow

### ✅ Happy Path Test Scenario (NOW WORKING)
1. User uploads a 30-minute coaching session audio file (US001) ✅
2. System processes audio with Google Speech-to-Text v2 (US002) ✅
3. User sees real-time processing status with progress bar (US003) ✅
4. Transcription completes with timeline segments and speaker separation ✅
5. User can view complete transcript with timestamps ✅
6. Links audio to existing coaching session record (US008) 🚧
7. Selects Traditional Chinese as language (US006) 🚧
8. System automatically identifies Speaker 1 as Coach, Speaker 2 as Client (US005) 📝
9. Downloads transcript in VTT format with role labels (US004) 📝

### Error Path Test Scenario
1. User uploads corrupted audio file (US001 - validation)
2. System rejects with clear error message
3. User uploads valid file but STT fails (US002 - error handling)
4. System retries and notifies user of issue (US005 - status)
5. User manually retries successful upload
