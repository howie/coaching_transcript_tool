### 6. Factory Pattern Integration
- **File**: `src/coaching_assistant/infrastructure/factories.py`
- **Requirements**:
  - Add ECPay service factory with HTTP client injection
  - Add notification service factory
  - Complete dependency injection

## E2E Demonstration Workflow

### Demo Script: "Subscription Payment Lifecycle"

**Pre-requisites**: Test ECPay sandbox environment, test user with subscription

1. **Create Subscription** - POST `/api/v1/subscriptions`
   ```json
   {
     "plan_id": "PRO",
     "payment_method": "ecpay_credit_card"
   }
   ```
   - Verify ECPay authorization created
   - Expected: 201 Created with subscription details

2. **Simulate Payment Failure** - Trigger payment retry scenario
   - Background task detects failed payment
   - Expected: Automatic retry via ECPay API

3. **Manual Payment Retry** - POST `/api/v1/subscriptions/{id}/retry-payment`
   - Verify manual retry triggers ECPay API call
   - Expected: 200 OK with retry status

4. **Plan Upgrade with Payment** - PATCH `/api/v1/subscriptions/{id}/plan`
   ```json
   {
     "new_plan_id": "ENTERPRISE"
   }
   ```
   - Verify prorated payment calculation
   - Verify ECPay charge processing
   - Expected: Successful upgrade with payment confirmation

5. **Subscription Cancellation** - DELETE `/api/v1/subscriptions/{id}`
   - Verify ECPay authorization cancellation
   - Verify refund calculation (if applicable)
   - Verify cancellation notification email
   - Expected: Proper cancellation with refund processing

6. **Email Notifications Verification** - Check notification system
   - Payment failure notification sent
   - Retry success notification sent
   - Cancellation confirmation sent
   - Expected: All relevant emails delivered

## Success Metrics

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (Required)
```bash
# Test ECPay service business logic
pytest tests/unit/core/services/test_ecpay_service.py -v

# Test notification service
pytest tests/unit/infrastructure/test_notification_service.py -v
```

### Integration Tests (Required)
```bash
# Test ECPay API client
pytest tests/integration/infrastructure/test_ecpay_client.py -v

# Test subscription tasks
pytest tests/integration/tasks/test_subscription_maintenance_tasks.py -v
```

### E2E Tests (Required)
```bash
# Complete payment workflow
pytest tests/e2e/test_subscription_payment_lifecycle.py -v
```

### Manual Verification (Required)
- ECPay sandbox environment payment processing
- Email notifications received in test inbox
- Billing dashboard shows proper payment status
- Refund processing visible in admin interface

## Dependencies

### Blocked By
- None (can start immediately)

### Blocking
- **WP6-Cleanup-4**: Notification system completion enables other features
- **Revenue Operations**: Billing reliability depends on this

### External Dependencies
- **ECPay Sandbox Access**: Required for testing
- **Email Service Configuration**: Required for notifications

- **Error Handling**: No sensitive data in error messages

## Delivery Timeline

- **Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days (1 developer)
- **Critical Path**: ECPay client ‚Üí service integration ‚Üí task completion ‚Üí testing
- **Deliverable**: Fully functional payment processing with E2E demo
