# Success Metrics for Clean Architecture Refactoring

## Overview

This document defines quantifiable metrics to measure the success of our Clean Architecture refactoring initiative.

## 📊 Technical Metrics

### Code Quality Metrics

#### Architecture Compliance
- [ ] **Zero SQLAlchemy imports** in `core/services/` directory
  ```bash
  # Validation command
  grep -r "from sqlalchemy" src/coaching_assistant/core/services/ || echo "✅ No SQLAlchemy imports found"
  ```

- [ ] **Zero direct Session usage** in API and service layers
  ```bash
  # Check for Session parameters
  grep -r "Session.*=" src/coaching_assistant/api/ | wc -l  # Should be 0
  grep -r "Session.*=" src/coaching_assistant/core/services/ | wc -l  # Should be 0
  ```

- [ ] **All business logic** in use cases (not API or infrastructure)
  ```bash
  # Check for business rules in wrong places
  grep -r "plan.*limit\|raise.*Exception" src/coaching_assistant/api/ | wc -l  # Should be minimal
  ```

#### Test Coverage
- [ ] **90%+ test coverage** for core business logic
  ```bash
  pytest --cov=src/coaching_assistant/core --cov-report=term-missing
  # Target: >90% coverage
  ```

- [ ] **All unit tests pass without database connection**
  ```bash
  # Run tests without database setup
  SKIP_DB_TESTS=1 pytest tests/unit/ -v
  # Target: 100% pass rate
  ```

- [ ] **Fast unit test execution** (< 100ms per service test)
  ```bash
  pytest tests/unit/test_usage_tracking_use_case.py --durations=10
  # Target: Each test < 100ms
  ```

### Performance Metrics

#### API Response Times
- [ ] **API response times unchanged** (< 5% degradation)
  ```bash
  # Before and after benchmarks
  ab -n 100 -c 10 http://localhost:8000/api/sessions
  # Target: <5% increase in response time
  ```

- [ ] **Memory usage stable** (< 10% increase)
  ```bash
  # Monitor memory usage during load testing
  # Target: <10% memory increase
  ```

#### Database Performance
- [ ] **Query count unchanged** (no N+1 problems introduced)
  ```python
  # Monitor SQL queries with logging
  # Target: Same or fewer queries per operation
  ```

- [ ] **Database connection pool efficiency** maintained
  ```bash
  # Monitor connection usage
  # Target: No connection leaks or pool exhaustion
  ```

## 🏗️ Architectural Metrics

### Dependency Analysis

#### Layer Separation
- [ ] **Clean dependency flow**: API → Services → Repositories → Infrastructure
  ```bash
  # Use dependency analysis tools
  pydeps src/coaching_assistant --max-bacon=3
  # Target: No circular dependencies
  ```

- [ ] **Zero circular dependencies** detected
  ```bash
  # Check for import cycles
  python -m pip install import-order
  import-order --check-cycles src/
  ```

#### Coupling Metrics
- [ ] **Services testable in isolation** (no infrastructure dependencies)
  ```python
  # All use case tests should run with in-memory repos only
  def test_create_usage_log_use_case():
      # Should not require database, HTTP clients, or external services
  ```

- [ ] **Repository abstraction effectiveness**
  ```python
  # Should be able to swap SQLAlchemy for in-memory implementations
  # without changing business logic
  ```

### Code Organization
- [ ] **Single Responsibility Principle** compliance
  ```bash
  # Check class and method sizes
  radon cc src/coaching_assistant/core/services/ -a
  # Target: Average complexity < 5
  ```

- [ ] **Interface Segregation** - Small, focused repository interfaces
  ```python
  # Repository interfaces should have focused responsibilities
  # No "god" repositories with too many methods
  ```

## 🚀 Developer Experience Metrics

### Development Velocity
- [ ] **Faster feature development** - New features require changes in fewer layers
  ```
  # Measure: Number of files modified per feature
  # Target: <3 files per typical feature
  ```

- [ ] **Reduced debugging time** - Clear separation makes issues easier to locate
  ```
  # Measure: Time to identify root cause of bugs
  # Target: 25% reduction in debugging time
  ```

#### Testing Experience
- [ ] **Easier test writing** - Business logic tests don't need database setup
  ```python
  # New business logic tests should be simple:
  def test_user_plan_limits():
      user = User(plan=UserPlan.FREE)
      assert user.can_create_session() is True  # No DB needed
  ```

- [ ] **Faster test feedback** - Unit tests run quickly during development
  ```bash
  # Measure test execution time
  time pytest tests/unit/
  # Target: <5 seconds for full unit test suite
  ```

### Code Maintainability
- [ ] **Clearer code organization** - Developers can find business logic easily
  ```
  # Survey: Team confidence in locating business rules
  # Target: 90% confidence in finding relevant code
  ```

- [ ] **Easier mocking for tests** - Clear interfaces make mocking straightforward
  ```python
  # Mocking should be simple and focused
  mock_user_repo = Mock(spec=UserRepoPort)
  use_case = CreateUsageLogUseCase(user_repo=mock_user_repo)
  ```

## 📈 Business Impact Metrics

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] **Fewer production bugs** related to business logic
  ```
  # Track: Business logic bugs per month
  # Target: 50% reduction after 3 months
  ```

- [ ] **Faster bug resolution** - Issues isolated to specific layers
  ```
  # Track: Average time to fix business logic bugs
  # Target: 30% faster resolution
  ```

### Feature Delivery
- [ ] **Consistent feature delivery velocity** - No slowdown during migration
  ```
  # Track: Story points delivered per sprint
  # Target: No decrease during migration
  ```

- [ ] **Reduced regression bugs** - Better test coverage prevents regressions
  ```
  # Track: Regression bugs per release
  # Target: 40% reduction in regressions
  ```

## 🔍 Validation Methods

### Automated Validation
```bash
# Architecture compliance check script
#!/bin/bash
echo "🔍 Checking architecture compliance..."

# Check for SQLAlchemy in core services
SQLA_VIOLATIONS=$(grep -r "from sqlalchemy" src/coaching_assistant/core/services/ | wc -l)
if [ $SQLA_VIOLATIONS -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "✅ No SQLAlchemy imports in core services"
else
  echo "❌ Found $SQLA_VIOLATIONS SQLAlchemy imports in core services"
fi

# Check test coverage
echo "📊 Checking test coverage..."
pytest --cov=src/coaching_assistant/core --cov-report=term | grep TOTAL

# Check for circular dependencies
echo "🔄 Checking for circular dependencies..."
python -c "import src.coaching_assistant; print('✅ No import errors')" 2>/dev/null || echo "❌ Import issues detected"

echo "🏁 Architecture validation complete"
```

### Manual Validation
- Code reviews using architectural checklist
- Regular architecture health checks
- Team retrospectives on development experience

### Performance Benchmarking
```python
# Performance benchmark script
import time
import requests
import statistics

def benchmark_api_endpoint(url, num_requests=100):
    """Benchmark API endpoint performance."""
    times = []
    for _ in range(num_requests):
        start = time.time()
        response = requests.get(url)
        end = time.time()
        times.append(end - start)
    
    return {
        'mean': statistics.mean(times),
        'median': statistics.median(times),
        'p95': sorted(times)[int(0.95 * len(times))]
    }

# Run before and after migration
baseline = benchmark_api_endpoint('http://localhost:8000/api/sessions')
print(f"Baseline performance: {baseline}")
```
