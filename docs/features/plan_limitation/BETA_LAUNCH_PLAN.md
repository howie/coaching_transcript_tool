# Beta Launch Plan - Plan Limitation System
## 🎯 Goal: Safe Beta Launch with Cost Protection

**Target Date**: August 20, 2025  
**Status**: 🚧 Pre-Launch Phase  
**Priority**: 🔴 CRITICAL - Prevent cost escalation

## 📋 Beta Launch Checklist

### **Phase 1: Critical Safety Implementation (Aug 16-18)**

#### 🔴 Database & Backend (CRITICAL)
- [ ] **DB Migration Execution**
  - [ ] Run plan limitation migration in production
  - [ ] Verify all users have `plan` field set to 'free'
  - [ ] Initialize usage counters (`session_count`, `transcription_count`)
  - [ ] Test rollback procedure

- [ ] **API Limit Enforcement**
  - [ ] Session creation endpoint enforces limits
  - [ ] Transcription endpoints check usage before processing  
  - [ ] File upload validates size and plan limits
  - [ ] All endpoints return proper error messages when limits exceeded

- [ ] **Usage Tracking Accuracy**
  - [ ] Session creation increments counters correctly
  - [ ] Transcription completion updates usage accurately
  - [ ] Monthly usage reset mechanism works
  - [ ] Usage calculation handles edge cases (failures, retries)

#### 🟡 Frontend Safety (HIGH)
- [ ] **UI Limit Blocking**
  - [ ] AudioUploader blocks uploads when limits reached
  - [ ] Session creation disabled for limit-exceeded users
  - [ ] Transcription buttons disabled appropriately
  - [ ] Clear error messages in Chinese and English

- [ ] **User Experience**
  - [ ] Usage progress bars show accurate data
  - [ ] Plan upgrade prompts appear when needed
  - [ ] Limit warnings show before reaching 100%

### **Phase 2: Conservative Launch Settings (Aug 18-19)**

#### 🔒 Conservative Plan Limits
```typescript
// BETA LAUNCH LIMITS (More restrictive than final)
const BETA_PLAN_LIMITS = {
  free: {
    maxSessions: 3,        // Reduced from 10
    maxMinutes: 60,        // Reduced from 120  
    maxTranscriptions: 5,  // Reduced from 20
    maxFileSize: 25,       // Reduced from 50MB
  }
}
```

#### 📊 Monitoring Setup
- [ ] **Usage Analytics Dashboard**
  - [ ] Real-time usage monitoring
  - [ ] Cost tracking per user/session
  - [ ] Alert thresholds for unusual activity
  - [ ] Daily usage reports

- [ ] **Safety Alerts**
  - [ ] High usage user alerts (>80% of limit)
  - [ ] Rapid usage increase alerts
  - [ ] Failed limit enforcement alerts
  - [ ] Cost threshold alerts

### **Phase 3: Beta Testing (Aug 19-20)**

#### 🧪 Testing Protocol
- [ ] **Internal Testing**
  - [ ] Test all limit scenarios with different plans
  - [ ] Verify usage counting accuracy
  - [ ] Test limit bypass attempts
  - [ ] Validate error handling

- [ ] **Limited Beta Release**
  - [ ] Start with 10 existing users
  - [ ] Monitor for 24 hours
  - [ ] Expand to 25 users if stable
  - [ ] Full beta release if no issues

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### **Cost Control Circuit Breakers**
```typescript
// EMERGENCY LIMITS (Absolute maximum)
const EMERGENCY_LIMITS = {
  maxDailyTranscriptions: 50,     // System-wide limit
  maxConcurrentSessions: 10,      // Prevent resource exhaustion  
  maxDailyNewUsers: 20,           // Control growth rate
  maxFileSize: 25,                // Prevent large file uploads
}
```

### **Emergency Response Plan**
1. **High Cost Alert (>$100/day)**
   - [ ] Immediately reduce all limits by 50%
   - [ ] Disable new user registrations
   - [ ] Contact all active beta users

2. **System Overload**
   - [ ] Enable queue system for transcriptions
   - [ ] Temporarily disable free plan uploads
   - [ ] Scale down processing capacity

3. **Limit Bypass Detected**
   - [ ] Immediately disable affected user accounts
   - [ ] Audit all usage logs for anomalies
   - [ ] Patch security vulnerabilities

## 📈 Success Metrics for Beta

### **Safety Metrics (Primary)**
- **Daily Cost**: <$50/day maximum
- **Usage Accuracy**: 100% accurate usage tracking
- **Limit Enforcement**: 0 successful limit bypasses
- **System Stability**: 99% uptime during beta

### **User Experience Metrics (Secondary)**  
- **User Onboarding**: >80% complete first session
- **Limit Understanding**: <10% support requests about limits
- **Upgrade Interest**: >20% users view upgrade page
- **Error Clarity**: <5% confusion about error messages

## 🛠️ Implementation Tasks

### **Immediate (Today - Aug 16)**
1. **Database Migration**
   ```bash
   # Execute in production
   alembic upgrade head
   
   # Verify migration
   SELECT plan, COUNT(*) FROM "user" GROUP BY plan;
   ```

2. **API Hardening**
   ```python
   # Add to all session/transcription endpoints
   @require_plan_validation
   def create_session():
       # Implementation with strict limits
   ```

### **Next 24 Hours (Aug 17)**
1. **Conservative Limits Deployment**
2. **Monitoring Dashboard Setup**  
3. **Internal Testing**

### **Beta Launch (Aug 18-20)**
1. **Gradual User Rollout**
2. **24/7 Monitoring**
3. **Daily Safety Reviews**

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

### **Rollback Triggers**
- Daily cost exceeds $75
- More than 3 limit bypass incidents  
- System stability drops below 95%
- User complaints exceed 15% of beta users

### **Rollback Procedure**
1. **Immediate**: Disable all free plan transcriptions
2. **5 minutes**: Revert to previous application version
3. **15 minutes**: Rollback database migration if needed
4. **30 minutes**: Contact all beta users with explanation

## 📞 Team Responsibilities

**Engineering Lead**: Overall execution and technical decisions  
**Backend Engineer**: API enforcement and database migration  
**Frontend Engineer**: UI limiting and user experience  
**Product Manager**: User communication and success metrics  
**DevOps**: Monitoring, alerts, and emergency response  

---

**This plan prioritizes safety and cost control over feature completeness. Better to launch conservatively and expand than to risk uncontrolled costs.**

**Next Action**: Execute database migration and API hardening immediately.
