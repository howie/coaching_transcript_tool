# i18n Fixes Completed - Plan Limitation Feature

## Date: 2025-08-16

## Summary
Comprehensive internationalization (i18n) fixes have been completed across all dashboard pages to resolve issues where Chinese text was appearing in English mode.

## Root Cause
The i18n language detection during SSR/hydration was defaulting to Chinese during the non-mounted state, causing a mismatch between server and client rendering.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Core i18n Fix
- **File**: `apps/web/contexts/i18n-context.tsx`
  - Removed problematic mounted state that defaulted to Chinese
  - Updated to read language from `data-lang` attribute for immediate correct language detection
  
- **File**: `apps/web/app/layout.tsx`
  - Added language initialization script in head section
  - Script runs before React hydration to detect and set language preference
  - Sets `data-lang` attribute on HTML element for immediate access

### 2. Pages Fixed

#### Coach Profile (`apps/web/app/dashboard/profile/page.tsx`)
- Replaced all 25+ hardcoded Chinese strings with translation keys
- Fixed section headers, form labels, placeholders, success/error messages
- Added comprehensive translation keys for professional information fields

#### Billing Pages
- **Payment Settings** (`apps/web/app/dashboard/billing/payment-settings/page.tsx`)
  - Fixed hardcoded payment method labels
  - Added i18n support for billing cycle and payment cards
  
- **Change Plan** (`apps/web/app/dashboard/billing/change-plan/page.tsx`)
  - Fixed billing cycle labels
  - Updated confirmation messages

#### Client Management (`apps/web/app/dashboard/clients/page.tsx`)
- Fixed client status labels (first_session, in_progress, paused, completed)
- Fixed client source labels (referral, organic, social_media, etc.)
- Fixed client type labels (paid, pro_bono, free_practice)
- Updated issue type display

#### Sessions Page (`apps/web/app/dashboard/sessions/page.tsx`)
- Fixed transcript status badges
- Fixed currency labels for all supported currencies
- Updated status messages for transcription states

#### Audio Analysis (`apps/web/app/dashboard/audio-analysis/page.tsx`)
- Fixed download button labels
- Fixed transcription cost display
- Updated remove button text

### 3. Translation Keys Added
Added 50+ new translation keys to `apps/web/lib/translations.ts` including:
- Profile fields (experience levels, certifications, countries)
- Plan types and billing information
- Form labels and placeholders
- Success and error messages
- Status labels and badges

## Testing Verification
All pages have been tested in both English and Chinese modes to ensure:
- No hardcoded text appears in the wrong language
- All dynamic content switches properly with language selection
- No hydration mismatches occur
- Form validations and messages display in the correct language

## Technical Details

### Language Detection Flow
1. User preference stored in localStorage
2. Script in layout.tsx runs before React hydration
3. Sets data-lang attribute on HTML element
4. i18nProvider reads from data-lang immediately
5. No default to Chinese during SSR/hydration

### Pattern for Future Development
When adding new pages or components:
```typescript
// Always use the useI18n hook
const { t } = useI18n();

// Never hardcode text
<label>{t('form.label.email')}</label>

// Add translation keys to translations.ts
export const translations = {
  en: { 'form.label.email': 'Email' },
  zh: { 'form.label.email': '電子郵件' }
}
```

## Files Modified
1. `apps/web/contexts/i18n-context.tsx` - Core i18n provider fix
2. `apps/web/app/layout.tsx` - Language initialization script
3. `apps/web/app/dashboard/profile/page.tsx` - Profile page i18n
4. `apps/web/app/dashboard/billing/payment-settings/page.tsx` - Payment settings i18n
5. `apps/web/app/dashboard/billing/change-plan/page.tsx` - Plan change i18n
6. `apps/web/app/dashboard/clients/page.tsx` - Client management i18n
7. `apps/web/app/dashboard/sessions/page.tsx` - Sessions page i18n
8. `apps/web/app/dashboard/audio-analysis/page.tsx` - Audio analysis i18n
9. `apps/web/lib/translations.ts` - All new translation keys
10. `apps/web/components/billing/PaymentSettings.tsx` - Component i18n updates

## Impact
- All dashboard pages now properly support English and Chinese languages
- No hardcoded text remains in any of the major dashboard pages
- Language switching is instantaneous and consistent across all pages
- Improved user experience for both English and Chinese users

## Next Steps
- Continue to use i18n patterns for any new features
- Consider adding more language support in the future
- Ensure all new components follow the established i18n patterns
