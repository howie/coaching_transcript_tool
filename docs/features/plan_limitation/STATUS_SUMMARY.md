- **Frontend State**: Component-level state with API fallback to mock data
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with consistent response format

### Implementation Choices
- **Plan Configuration**: Currently hardcoded in Python, migration to DB planned
- **Usage Calculation**: Real-time from user model fields
- **Frontend Framework**: React hooks for state management
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with mock data fallback
- **i18n**: Full internationalization support (zh/en)

### Technology Stack Updates
- **Backend**: FastAPI with plan router module
- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **API Client**: Generic HTTP methods added to support plan service
- **State Management**: React hooks with service layer abstraction
