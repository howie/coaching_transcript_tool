# Coach Profile Feature Implementation Summary

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

This document summarizes the successful implementation of the coach profile feature, replacing the previous personal settings with a comprehensive coach profile management system.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Frontend TypeScript Errors
- **Problem**: `Type error: Argument of type '(prev: never[]) => any[]' is not assignable`
- **Solution**: Added proper TypeScript types to state arrays:
  ```typescript
  const [coachProfile, setCoachProfile] = useState<any>(null)
  const [coachingPlans, setCoachingPlans] = useState<any[]>([])
  // And proper array typing in formData
  coaching_languages: [] as string[],
  certifications: [] as string[],
  specialties: [] as string[],
  ```

### 2. Backend Import Error
- **Problem**: `ImportError: cannot import name 'get_async_db'` 
- **Solution**: Converted all API endpoints from async/await pattern to synchronous SQLAlchemy patterns to match the existing codebase:
  ```python
  # Old (async)
  from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession
  async def get_coach_profile(db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_async_db))
  
  # New (sync)  
  from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
  def get_coach_profile(db: Session = Depends(get_db))
  ```

## Implementation Details

### ✅ Database Schema
- **CoachProfile**: Complete model with basic info, languages, communication tools, professional details
- **CoachingPlan**: Flexible pricing plans with computed properties
- **Migration**: `888cb25741df_add_coach_profile_fields.py`

### ✅ Backend API (Synchronous)
- **Coach Profile Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/coach-profile/` - Get profile
  - `POST /api/coach-profile/` - Create profile  
  - `PUT /api/coach-profile/` - Update profile
  - `DELETE /api/coach-profile/` - Delete profile
- **Coaching Plans Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/coach-profile/plans` - List plans
  - `POST /api/coach-profile/plans` - Create plan
  - `PUT /api/coach-profile/plans/{id}` - Update plan
  - `DELETE /api/coach-profile/plans/{id}` - Delete plan

### ✅ Frontend UI (React/TypeScript)
- **Removed**: Upgrade prompts, construction banners, password settings, payment settings
- **Added**: Professional coach profile interface with:
  - Basic information (photo, name, contact, location)
  - Multi-language service selections
  - Communication tool preferences  
  - Professional credentials and experience
  - Coaching plans management with modal interface
  - Public/private visibility controls
  - Edit/save functionality with proper state management

### ✅ Testing Coverage
- **Backend**: Unit tests for models and API endpoints
- **Frontend**: Component tests with React Testing Library
- **Integration**: curl test script for end-to-end validation

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Professional Profile Management
- Public display name and photo
- Contact information with timezone support
- Professional experience and certifications
- Bio and specialties

### 2. Service Configuration
- Multi-language coaching services
- Communication platform preferences
- Flexible pricing plan system

### 3. Modern UI/UX
- Edit mode with validation
- Modal dialogs for plan management
- Responsive design with proper loading states
- Clear navigation and user feedback

## Files Created/Modified

### Backend
- `src/coaching_assistant/models/coach_profile.py` - New models
- `src/coaching_assistant/api/coach_profile.py` - New API endpoints
- `alembic/versions/888cb25741df_add_coach_profile_fields.py` - Database migration
- `tests/models/test_coach_profile.py` - Unit tests
- `tests/api/test_coach_profile_api.py` - API tests

### Frontend  
- `app/dashboard/profile/page.tsx` - Completely rewritten profile page
- `app/dashboard/profile/__tests__/page.test.tsx` - Component tests

### Testing
- `scripts/api-tests/test_coach_profile.sh` - Integration test script

## Build Status
- ✅ Frontend build: SUCCESS (Next.js production build completed)
- ✅ Backend import: SUCCESS (all modules load without errors)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: SUCCESS (no type errors)

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Database Migration**: Run `alembic upgrade head` in production environment
2. **Environment Variables**: Ensure proper database connection strings are configured
3. **API Testing**: Execute integration tests with `./scripts/api-tests/test_coach_profile.sh`
4. **Frontend Deployment**: Deploy updated frontend build to Cloudflare Workers

## Technical Notes

- The implementation uses synchronous SQLAlchemy patterns consistent with the existing codebase
- JSON fields are used for flexible storage of arrays (languages, certifications, etc.)
- Proper validation and error handling throughout the API layer
- Component state management follows React best practices
- TypeScript types ensure compile-time safety

The coach profile feature is now ready for production deployment and provides a comprehensive solution for coaches to manage their professional presence and service offerings.
