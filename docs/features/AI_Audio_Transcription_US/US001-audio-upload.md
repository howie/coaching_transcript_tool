  Creates new session and returns upload URL

POST /api/v1/sessions/{id}/complete-upload
  Marks upload as complete and triggers processing
```

### Dependencies
- Google Cloud Storage SDK
- FastAPI for API endpoints
- SQLAlchemy for database operations

### Configuration
```yaml
STORAGE_BUCKET: coaching-audio-{env}
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB: 1024
MAX_DURATION_MINUTES: 120
RETENTION_DAYS: 1
SIGNED_URL_EXPIRY_MINUTES: 30
```

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Large file upload fails | Poor UX | Implement chunked upload |
| GCS quota exceeded | Service unavailable | Monitor usage, set alerts |
| Malicious file upload | Security breach | Strict file validation |

## Specification by Example

### Example 1: Successful Upload
**Given** I am a logged-in coach  
**And** I have a 45-minute MP3 file (250 MB)  
**When** I select the file and click upload  
**Then** I should see a progress bar starting from 0%  
**And** the file should upload directly to GCS  
**And** a session record should be created with status "pending"  
**And** I should see "Upload complete" when finished  

### Example 2: File Too Large
**Given** I am a logged-in coach  
**And** I have a 1.5 GB MP3 file  
**When** I try to select the file  
**Then** I should see error: "File size exceeds 1 GB limit"  
**And** the upload should not start  
**And** no session record should be created  

### Example 3: Invalid Format
**Given** I am a logged-in coach  
**And** I have a PDF file named "session.pdf"  
**When** I try to upload it  
**Then** I should see error: "Invalid file format. Supported: MP3, WAV, M4A, OGG"  
**And** the upload should be prevented  

### Example 4: Duration Too Long
**Given** I am a logged-in coach  
**And** I have a 3-hour MP3 file (500 MB)  
**When** I upload the file  
**Then** the upload should complete  
**But** validation should fail with: "Audio duration exceeds 120 minutes limit"  
**And** the file should be deleted from storage  
**And** session status should be "failed"  

### Example 5: Auto-Deletion Warning
**Given** I am uploading an audio file  
**When** the upload interface loads  
**Then** I should see warning: "Files will be automatically deleted after 24 hours"  
**And** the warning should be in orange/yellow color  
**And** there should be a link to "Learn more about data retention"  

### Example 6: Network Interruption
**Given** I am uploading a 500 MB file  
**And** the upload is at 50% progress  
**When** the network connection is lost  
**Then** I should see error: "Upload interrupted. Please check your connection"  
**And** there should be a "Retry" button  
**When** I click "Retry" after reconnecting  
**Then** the upload should resume from where it stopped  

## Notes for QA
- Test with edge cases: 0-byte files, exactly 1GB files, 120-minute files
- Verify cleanup job deletes files after retention period
- Check audit logs capture all upload events
- Test concurrent uploads from same user

## deployment 

Google Cloud Storage Bucket Setup Instructions

  Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project (if you don't have one)

  1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
  2. Click "Select a project" → "New Project"
  3. Enter project name (e.g., "coaching-assistant-prod")
  4. Note the Project ID (you'll need this)

  Step 2: Enable Required APIs

  # Enable Google Cloud Storage API
  gcloud services enable storage.googleapis.com

  # Enable IAM API (if not already enabled)
  gcloud services enable iam.googleapis.com

  Step 3: Create the Storage Bucket

  # Set your environment (development/staging/production)
  ENVIRONMENT=development  # or staging, production

  # Create the bucket with proper naming based on environment
  case $ENVIRONMENT in
    development)
      BUCKET_SUFFIX=dev
      ;;
    staging)
      BUCKET_SUFFIX=staging
      ;;
    production)
      BUCKET_SUFFIX=prod
      ;;
    *)
      BUCKET_SUFFIX=dev
      ;;
  esac

  # Create the bucket
  gsutil mb -p YOUR_PROJECT_ID -c STANDARD -l us-central1 gs://coaching-audio-${BUCKET_SUFFIX}

  # Set bucket lifecycle for auto-deletion (24 hours)
  cat > lifecycle.json << EOF
  {
    "rule": [
      {
        "action": {"type": "Delete"},
        "condition": {"age": 1}
      }
    ]
  }
  EOF

  gsutil lifecycle set lifecycle.json gs://coaching-audio-${BUCKET_SUFFIX}

  # Set CORS policy for direct uploads
  cat > cors.json << EOF
  [
    {
      "origin": ["https://coachly.doxa.com.tw", "http://localhost:3000"],
      "method": ["GET", "PUT", "POST", "HEAD"],
      "responseHeader": ["Content-Type", "Access-Control-Allow-Origin"],
      "maxAgeSeconds": 3600
    }
  ]
  EOF

  gsutil cors set cors.json gs://coaching-audio-${BUCKET_SUFFIX}

  Step 4: Create Service Account

  # Create service account
  gcloud iam service-accounts create coaching-storage \
      --display-name="Coaching Assistant Storage Account" \
      --description="Service account for audio file storage operations"

  # Get the service account email
  SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL="coaching-storage@YOUR_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com"

  # Grant bucket permissions
  gsutil iam ch serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}:objectAdmin gs://coaching-audio-${BUCKET_SUFFIX}
  gsutil iam ch serviceAccount:${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}:legacyBucketReader gs://coaching-audio-${BUCKET_SUFFIX}

  Step 5: Generate Service Account Key

  # Create and download the service account key
  gcloud iam service-accounts keys create coaching-storage-key.json \
      --iam-account=${SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL}

  # Convert to base64 for environment variable
  base64 -i coaching-storage-key.json -o coaching-storage-key-base64.txt

  # The base64 content goes in GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON

  Step 6: Update Environment Variables

  Add these to your .env file:

  # Environment Configuration
  ENVIRONMENT=development  # or staging, production

  # Google Cloud Configuration
  GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
  GOOGLE_STORAGE_BUCKET=coaching-audio-dev  # or coaching-audio-staging, coaching-audio-prod
  GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON=base64-encoded-service-account-key

  # Storage Configuration  
  MAX_FILE_SIZE=1073741824  # 1GB in bytes
  MAX_AUDIO_DURATION=7200   # 120 minutes in seconds
  RETENTION_DAYS=1
  SIGNED_URL_EXPIRY_MINUTES=30

  Step 7: Test the Setup

  # Test bucket access
  gsutil ls gs://coaching-audio-${BUCKET_SUFFIX}

  # Test upload permissions
  echo "test" | gsutil cp - gs://coaching-audio-${BUCKET_SUFFIX}/test.txt
  gsutil rm gs://coaching-audio-${BUCKET_SUFFIX}/test.txt

  Step 8: Security & Production Setup

  For production, also consider:

  1. Enable bucket uniform access control:
  gsutil uniformbucketlevelaccess set on gs://coaching-audio-prod

  2. Set up monitoring:
  # Enable logging
  gsutil logging set on -b gs://coaching-logs gs://coaching-audio-prod

  3. Configure backup retention:
  # Set versioning for accidental deletions
  gsutil versioning set on gs://coaching-audio-prod

  Environment-Specific Buckets

  Create separate buckets for each environment:
  - coaching-audio-dev (for ENVIRONMENT=development)
  - coaching-audio-staging (for ENVIRONMENT=staging)  
  - coaching-audio-prod (for ENVIRONMENT=production)

  Quick Setup Script:

  # Set your values
  export PROJECT_ID="your-gcp-project-id"
  export ENVIRONMENT="development"  # or staging, production

  # Run the complete setup
  ./setup-gcs.sh $PROJECT_ID $ENVIRONMENT
  
  🔒 SECURITY WARNING: The script will create coaching-storage-{environment}.json
  This file contains sensitive credentials and is automatically added to .gitignore
  Never commit this file to version control!

  Final Verification

  Test the integration by:
  1. Starting your API server
  2. Going to /dashboard/sessions/audio-upload
  3. Trying to upload a small audio file
  4. Checking the bucket in Google Cloud Console

  The implementation is now complete and ready for testing! The audio upload feature fully
  meets all requirements in US001 with proper validation, security, and user experience.
