- **P1 (High)**: Important for user experience, should be in MVP
- **P2 (Medium)**: Nice to have, enhances product value
- **P3 (Low)**: Future enhancement, not essential for launch

## Status Definitions

- 🔵 **Ready**: Fully defined with AC and DoD, ready for development
- 📝 **Draft**: Basic story written, needs refinement
- 💡 **Idea**: Concept identified, needs story writing
- 🚧 **In Progress**: Currently being developed
- ✅ **Done**: Completed and tested
- ❌ **Blocked**: Cannot proceed due to dependencies

## Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Core Pipeline (Sprint 1)
1. **US001** - Audio Upload (prerequisite for all)
2. **US002** - Transcription Processing (parallel with US001)
3. **US005** - Status Tracking (depends on US002)

### Phase 2: User Experience (Sprint 2)
4. **US004** - Export (depends on US002)
5. **US003** - Speaker Detection (depends on US002)
6. **US006** - Language Selection (enhances US002)

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future)
- Real-time updates
- Advanced exports
- Notifications
- Analytics

## Acceptance Testing Flow

### Happy Path Test Scenario
1. User uploads a 30-minute coaching session in Chinese (US001)
2. Selects Traditional Chinese as language (US006)
3. Sees processing status with progress bar (US005)
4. Transcription completes with speakers separated as "Speaker 1", "Speaker 2" (US002)
5. System automatically identifies Speaker 1 as Coach, Speaker 2 as Client (US003)
6. Downloads transcript in VTT format with role labels (US004)

### Error Path Test Scenario
1. User uploads corrupted audio file (US001 - validation)
2. System rejects with clear error message
3. User uploads valid file but STT fails (US002 - error handling)
4. System retries and notifies user of issue (US005 - status)
5. User manually retries successful upload
