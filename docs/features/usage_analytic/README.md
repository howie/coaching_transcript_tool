## Related Features

This feature is part of the broader billing and subscription management system but has been separated into its own module for better organization and maintainability.

## Technical Notes

This feature was moved from the `plan_limitation` directory as it represents a standalone analytics capability that extends beyond basic plan enforcement, making it more suitable as a dedicated usage analytics module.
