# Transcript Deletion - Usage and Revenue Verification

## Summary

After thorough investigation and testing, I can confirm that **deleting transcripts DOES NOT affect usage tracking, plan limits, or revenue calculations**.

## Key Findings

### 1. Usage and Revenue Calculations Are Independent

All usage and revenue calculations in the system rely **exclusively** on the coaching session's core fields:
- `duration_min` - Used for plan usage tracking
- `fee_amount` and `fee_currency` - Used for revenue calculations
- `session_date` - Used for time-based reporting
- `client_id` - Used for unique client counts

These fields are **permanently preserved** in the `coaching_session` table regardless of transcript status.

### 2. Repository Methods Verified

The following critical methods in `SQLAlchemyCoachingSessionRepository` were verified:

| Method | Purpose | Fields Used | Affected by Deletion? |
|--------|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| `get_total_minutes_for_user` | Total usage minutes | `duration_min` | ❌ No |
| `get_monthly_minutes_for_user` | Monthly usage tracking | `duration_min`, `session_date` | ❌ No |
| `get_monthly_revenue_by_currency` | Revenue reporting | `fee_amount`, `fee_currency` | ❌ No |
| `get_unique_clients_count_for_user` | Client analytics | `client_id` | ❌ No |

### 3. Deletion Preserves All Critical Data

When a transcript is deleted:
1. The coaching session record remains intact
2. All financial data (`fee_amount`, `fee_currency`) is preserved
3. All usage data (`duration_min`) is preserved
4. Speaking statistics are saved in `saved_speaking_stats` JSON field
5. Deletion timestamp is recorded in `transcript_deleted_at`
6. Only the `transcription_session_id` link is cleared

### 4. Test Coverage

Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/integration/test_usage_after_transcript_deletion.py` that verifies:

- ✅ Total minutes calculation unchanged after deletion
- ✅ Monthly minutes calculation unchanged after deletion
- ✅ Revenue calculations by currency unchanged after deletion
- ✅ Unique clients count unchanged after deletion
- ✅ Mixed deletion states handled correctly
- ✅ Speaking statistics preserved in deleted sessions

## Database Schema Protection

The `coaching_session` table structure ensures data integrity:

```sql
-- Core fields that are NEVER deleted
duration_min INTEGER NOT NULL,
fee_currency VARCHAR,
fee_amount DECIMAL,
session_date DATE NOT NULL,
client_id UUID NOT NULL,

-- Transcript relationship (can be nullified)
transcription_session_id UUID,  -- Set to NULL on deletion

-- Deletion tracking (added for history)
transcript_deleted_at TIMESTAMP,
saved_speaking_stats JSON
```

## Conclusion

The system architecture correctly separates:
- **Coaching Session Data** (permanent business records)
- **Transcript Data** (deletable user content)

This separation ensures that:
1. Users can delete transcripts for privacy
2. Business metrics remain accurate
3. Plan usage tracking continues correctly
4. Revenue reporting stays intact
5. Historical analytics are preserved

## Verification Commands

To verify in production:

```sql
-- Check sessions with deleted transcripts still count for usage
SELECT
    COUNT(*) as session_count,
    SUM(duration_min) as total_minutes,
    SUM(fee_amount) as total_revenue
FROM coaching_session
WHERE user_id = ?
  AND transcript_deleted_at IS NOT NULL;

-- Verify mixed states are handled correctly
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN transcript_deleted_at IS NOT NULL THEN 'deleted'
        WHEN transcription_session_id IS NOT NULL THEN 'has_transcript'
        ELSE 'never_uploaded'
    END as transcript_status,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    SUM(duration_min) as minutes,
    SUM(fee_amount) as revenue
FROM coaching_session
WHERE user_id = ?
GROUP BY transcript_status;
```
