## 💡 Notes & Decisions

### Technical Decisions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with JSONB for flexible metadata storage
- **Audit Storage**: Separate audit log table for performance isolation
- **Soft Delete**: Boolean flag + timestamp approach for simplicity
- **Usage Aggregation**: Daily batch processing for analytics summaries

### Business Decisions  
- **Billing Logic**: Failed retries are free, successful re-transcriptions are charged
- **Data Retention**: Usage logs are permanent, personal data follows GDPR timeline
- **GDPR Approach**: Anonymization over deletion for usage statistics preservation
