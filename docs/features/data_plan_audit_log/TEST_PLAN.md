## 🧪 Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests

#### 1.1 Usage Analytics Foundation Tests
```python
# Test Files: test_usage_analytics.py, test_usage_log_model.py

def test_usage_log_creation():
    """Test usage log entry creation for transcription events"""
    # Given: A completed transcription session
    # When: Usage log is created
    # Then: All required fields are populated correctly

def test_usage_analytics_aggregation():
    """Test monthly usage analytics calculation"""
    # Given: Multiple usage log entries
    # When: Analytics aggregation runs
    # Then: Monthly summaries are accurate

def test_usage_tracking_independence():
    """Test usage records persist after client deletion"""
    # Given: Client with transcription usage
    # When: Client is deleted
    # Then: Usage records remain intact and queryable
```

#### 1.2 Soft Delete System Tests
```python  
# Test Files: test_soft_delete.py, test_client_model.py

def test_client_soft_delete():
    """Test client soft deletion preserves data"""
    # Given: Active client with sessions
    # When: Soft delete is triggered
    # Then: Client marked inactive, data preserved

def test_soft_delete_query_filtering():
    """Test queries properly filter soft-deleted records"""
    # Given: Mix of active and soft-deleted clients
    # When: Standard client queries are made
    # Then: Only active clients are returned

def test_soft_delete_restoration():
    """Test soft-deleted client can be restored"""
    # Given: Soft-deleted client
    # When: Restoration is triggered
    # Then: Client becomes active again
```

#### 1.3 GDPR Compliance Tests
```python
# Test Files: test_gdpr_compliance.py, test_anonymization.py

def test_gdpr_anonymization():
    """Test personal data anonymization preserves usage stats"""
    # Given: Client with personal data and usage history
    # When: GDPR anonymization is triggered
    # Then: Personal data removed, usage stats anonymized but preserved

def test_data_retention_policy():
    """Test automated data retention policy execution"""
    # Given: Data older than retention period
    # When: Retention policy runs
    # Then: Personal data purged, usage logs retained
```

### 2. Integration Tests

#### 2.1 End-to-End Usage Tracking
```bash
# Test: Complete transcription workflow with usage tracking
curl -X POST /api/v1/sessions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"title": "Test Session", "language": "en-US"}'

# Verify: Usage log created after transcription completion
curl -X GET /api/v1/usage/sessions/$SESSION_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

#### 2.2 Smart Re-transcription Billing
```bash
# Test: Failed transcription retry (should not charge)
curl -X POST /api/v1/sessions/$SESSION_ID/retry-transcription \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Test: Successful re-transcription (should charge)
curl -X POST /api/v1/sessions/$SESSION_ID/retranscribe \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Verify: Billing logic correctly applied
curl -X GET /api/v1/usage/billing-summary \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

#### 2.3 Audit Trail Verification
```bash
# Test: All operations generate audit logs
curl -X POST /api/v1/clients \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"name": "Test Client"}'

curl -X DELETE /api/v1/clients/$CLIENT_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Verify: Complete audit trail exists
curl -X GET /api/v1/audit/logs?entity_type=client&entity_id=$CLIENT_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### 3. System Tests

    # When: Audit logging is enabled
    # Then: <5% performance degradation
```

#### 3.2 Data Volume Stress Tests  
```python
def test_large_usage_dataset():
    """Test system performance with large usage datasets"""
    # Given: 100,000+ usage log entries
    # When: Analytics queries are executed
    # Then: Response time <3 seconds
```

#### 3.3 Concurrent Operations Tests
```python
def test_concurrent_transcription_billing():
    """Test concurrent transcriptions with usage tracking"""
    # Given: 50 simultaneous transcription sessions
    # When: All complete simultaneously
    # Then: All usage logs created correctly, no race conditions
```

### 4. Security Tests

#### 4.1 Access Control Tests
```bash
# Test: Usage analytics require admin privileges
curl -X GET /api/v1/admin/usage/analytics \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER_TOKEN" \
  # Expected: 403 Forbidden

curl -X GET /api/v1/admin/usage/analytics \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  # Expected: 200 OK
```

#### 4.2 Audit Trail Integrity
