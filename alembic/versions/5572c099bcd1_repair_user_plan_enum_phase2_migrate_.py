PHASE 2: Migrate user data from uppercase to lowercase enum values

This migration completes the fix for production issue caused by migration 900f713316c0.

Phase 1 (previous migration 6d160a319b2c):
    - Added lowercase enum values (free, pro, enterprise, etc.)
    - Committed immediately to make them available

Phase 2 (THIS MIGRATION):
    - Safely migrate user data from uppercase to lowercase
    - Update all affected tables: user, plan_configurations, subscription_history

The two-phase approach ensures PostgreSQL's enum safety requirements are met.
